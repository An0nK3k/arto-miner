Removed by KeKHermanus 
Because low-end miners will even invest more electricity as they can make less coins as Big-Rig miners. 
For this reason the free choice to support the Original coders mentioned below.
I will also add some donation wallet adresses from myself.
Remember there is no need to donate but always welcome as i will be working on this miner to speed up AMD GPU mining
Yet Donations can be done to the origninal coders.
